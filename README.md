## About Me

I am Nickael and I am very happy to have had the opportunity to participate in this evaluation.


## The Project

I tried not to use any third party libraries so that I could show the maximum of my capabilities with Javascript, Typescript and React.


## Improvements

I think that with more time I could improve the layout, use some libraries to have more exciting animations.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:


### `yarn`

To install the dependencies.


### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
